## Roadmap

Potential features for future development:

- Support for multiple to-do lists
- Push notifications and reminders
- Enhanced profile customization
- Due date logic and sorting
- Dark mode optimization

---

## Motivation

I created OnTrak following a tutorial in order to learn more about SwiftUI, Xcode, Firebase, and IOS development in general. I would love to continue work on this project, specifically with notifcation handling so the user can complete lists of tasks utilizing either lock screen notifications or a widget without ever having to unlock the device.
